                        <p>I am currently a fourth year student attending the University of Alberta. I am interested on the causes drives human behavior and how technology can optimize human behavior. 
                            This curiosity has drawn me to take a double major in Computing Science and Psychology. </p>

                                <li>I love experimenting with things rather than settling with familiarity</li>
                                <li>Able to fail forward, and thus a quick learner</li>
                                <li>I enjoy problem solving and putting things together to reach a goal</li>
                                <li>Hobbies of mine are playing basketball, and working out</li>

                            <p>The most valuable asset that I offer is my effort and drive for problem solving. I am able to utilize various programming languages such as Java, Python, C, HTML, CSS, Django, SQL, Elasticsearch, and SPARQL in order to develop solutions for problems. 
                                 With experience in Human Psychology and Ergonomics, I am adept at identifying human usability issues during development. Although I believe in the agile approach to software development, I am open and knowledgable about other approaches such
                                 as Extreme Programming, Waterfall, and Spiral approaches.

                        <p><span>MedicalPhotoRecord</span> - A team project that is an android application that allows communication between patients and medical care providers.
                             The patient can post photos and descriptions of their symptoms for the medical care provider to observe. The main lessons and knowledge gained from this project was querying and interacting with API's such as Elasticsearch to manipulate and store data. 
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Selfluv</span> - A personal project that is an android application that allows users to create a vision board, create short term and long term goals, log emotions throughout the day and graphs all this information
                            to show the trajectory of production for the user. Through the process of creating this app, I was able gain proficiency in the structure of the android framework and in my skills with Java.

                        <p><span>Scripts for Runescape</span> - Created scripts using Java for botting on online MMO runescape</p>

                        <p><span>Various game solvers</span> - Used knowledge of algorithms such as alpha-beta negamax trees, 
                            dynamic programming, transposition tables, A* and Djikstra's algorithm to solve puzzle games.
